/*
In second query you have to sell one hamburgers and two chicken burgers.
Your income is 1⋅10+2⋅12=34
int income = beefPatties*ham_burger_price + chickenPatties*chi_burger_price;
raw material of ham_burger is beefPatties
raw material of chi_burger is chickenPatties

N.B: For each query print one integer — the maximum profit you can achieve.
So, maxProfit can be earned by selling max chicken burger, as chicken
burger price is higher than hamburger price! That's why, the for loop is
started by initializing the beefPatties to 0.
